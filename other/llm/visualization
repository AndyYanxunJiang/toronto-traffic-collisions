can we do traffic collision by neighbourhood
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can definitely visualize traffic collisions by neighborhood to provide a clearer view of how different neighborhoods are affected over time. Here's how you can modify your code to create a bar plot showing traffic collisions by neighborhood.

Step 1: Aggregate Data by Neighborhood
You will need to group the data by Neighbourhood and summarize the count of collisions.

Step 2: Plot Traffic Collisions by Neighborhood
Here's a code example that shows a bar chart of the number of traffic collisions by neighborhood:

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(Neighbourhood) %>%
  summarise(Count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Neighbourhood, -Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates to make it easier to read
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Traffic Collisions by Neighbourhood (2014-2024)",
       x = "Neighbourhood", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),  # Adjust text size for clarity
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8))
Explanation:
Group by Neighbourhood: The data is grouped by the Neighbourhood column, and the number of collisions is summarized (n() counts the number of rows per group).
Reordering: Neighborhoods are ordered by collision count in descending order for better readability.
coord_flip(): This flips the coordinates so that the neighborhoods are listed vertically on the y-axis, which is helpful if there are many neighborhoods.
Customization: The theme() and labs() functions customize the title and appearance of the plot.
This plot will give a simple and informative view of how collisions are distributed across different neighborhoods over the 2014-2024 period.

Let me know if you'd like to further customize the plot!

this is my cleaned data, give some informative plots to show trend
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here are some suggestions for informative plots based on the cleaned data you've shared:

1. Traffic Collisions by Neighborhood
This can help visualize which neighborhoods have the highest traffic collisions over the time period.

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(Neighbourhood_158) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(Neighbourhood_158, -Collisions), y = Collisions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates for readability
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Traffic Collisions by Neighborhood",
       x = "Neighborhood", y = "Total Collisions")
2. Monthly Traffic Collisions
This plot can help visualize whether certain months have more collisions than others.

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(OCC_MONTH) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OCC_MONTH, y = Collisions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Traffic Collisions by Month",
       x = "Month", y = "Total Collisions")
3. Hourly Distribution of Collisions
A line plot showing the number of collisions at different hours of the day.

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(OCC_HOUR) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OCC_HOUR, y = Collisions)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Hourly Distribution of Traffic Collisions",
       x = "Hour of Day", y = "Total Collisions")
4. Collisions Involving Different Vehicle Types
A bar plot to compare how often different vehicle types (automobile, motorcycle, etc.) are involved in collisions.

r
Copy code
data %>%
  select(AUTOMOBILE, MOTORCYCLE, PASSENGER, BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN) %>%
  gather(key = "Vehicle_Type", value = "Involved", -AUTOMOBILE, -MOTORCYCLE, -PASSENGER, -BICYCLE, -PEDESTRIAN) %>%
  group_by(Vehicle_Type) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = sum(Involved == "YES")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Collisions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Collisions Involving Different Vehicle Types",
       x = "Vehicle Type", y = "Total Collisions")
5. Collision Trends by Year
This plot can give an overview of how traffic collisions have changed over the years.

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(OCC_YEAR) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OCC_YEAR, y = Collisions)) +
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Traffic Collisions by Year",
       x = "Year", y = "Total Collisions")
These plots will provide a clearer picture of the trends and distribution of traffic collisions in your dataset. Let me know if you need further modifications or if you'd like to focus on a specific aspect!

It seems like the column name Neighbourhood_158 does not exist in your dataset, or it may have a different name. To troubleshoot this:

Check for column names: You can print the column names to verify the exact name of the neighborhood column.
r
Copy code
colnames(data)
Correct column name: Once you have the correct name, replace Neighbourhood_158 with the actual column name in the code.
For instance, if the correct column name is NEIGHBOURHOOD, you can modify the code like this:

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(NEIGHBOURHOOD) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(NEIGHBOURHOOD, -Collisions), y = Collisions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates for readability
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Traffic Collisions by Neighborhood",
       x = "Neighborhood", y = "Total Collisions")
Please run colnames(data) and check the exact name of the neighborhood column, and then adjust the code accordingly. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Thank you for confirming the column name is NEIGHBOURHOOD_158. You can use the following code to generate a plot of traffic collisions by neighborhood:

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(NEIGHBOURHOOD_158) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(NEIGHBOURHOOD_158, -Collisions), y = Collisions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip the coordinates for readability
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Traffic Collisions by Neighborhood",
       x = "Neighborhood", y = "Total Collisions")
This will create a bar plot of total traffic collisions per neighborhood, with the neighborhoods sorted by the number of collisions.

Let me know if it works or if you'd like further adjustments!

The error indicates that the Vehicle_Type column was not successfully created in the gather() function. Here’s an updated version of your code using pivot_longer() instead of gather(), as gather() has been deprecated. This should fix the issue:

r
Copy code
data %>%
  select(AUTOMOBILE, MOTORCYCLE, PASSENGER, BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(AUTOMOBILE, MOTORCYCLE, PASSENGER, BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN),
               names_to = "Vehicle_Type", values_to = "Involved") %>%
  group_by(Vehicle_Type) %>%
  summarise(Collisions = sum(Involved == "YES")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Collisions)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "green") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Collisions Involving Different Vehicle Types",
       x = "Vehicle Type", y = "Total Collisions")
This code uses pivot_longer() to reshape the data, creating a Vehicle_Type column for each vehicle type (automobile, motorcycle, etc.) and counts the number of collisions where the type is involved ("YES"). It then plots the results.

Let me know if this resolves the issue!






You said:

and give me the graph of 3 types of collisions depending on how you think its best to show teh trned
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For the three types of collisions—INJURY_COLLISIONS, FTR_COLLISIONS, and PD_COLLISIONS—a line plot showing the trends over time would be an effective way to visualize these collision types, especially if you're interested in seeing how the trends change across years or months.

Here's a sample code that creates a line plot for each of the collision types, aggregated by month:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming the dataset is named 'data'
data %>%
  group_by(OCC_MONTH, OCC_YEAR) %>%
  summarise(Injury = sum(INJURY_COLLISIONS == "YES"),
            FTR = sum(FTR_COLLISIONS == "YES"),
            PD = sum(PD_COLLISIONS == "YES")) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Injury, FTR, PD),
               names_to = "Collision_Type", values_to = "Count") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OCC_MONTH, y = Count, color = Collision_Type, group = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ OCC_YEAR, ncol = 1) + # Facet by year
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Trends of Collision Types Over Time",
       x = "Month", y = "Number of Collisions",
       color = "Collision Type") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
This code will:

Aggregate the number of collisions by month and year.
Use pivot_longer() to combine the collision types (Injury, FTR, PD) into a single column for easier plotting.
Plot a line for each type of collision, colored differently, and grouped by collision type.
Use facet wrapping to show each year's data separately, making it easier to compare trends within and across years.
Let me know if this suits your needs or if you’d like any adjustments!

just show how many of each type of collision 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To show the total number of each type of collision (INJURY_COLLISIONS, FTR_COLLISIONS, and PD_COLLISIONS) across the entire dataset, a simple bar plot will effectively convey this information.

Here’s a code example to create a bar chart that displays the total number of each type of collision:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Summarize the total counts of each collision type
collision_summary <- data %>%
  summarise(Injury_Collisions = sum(INJURY_COLLISIONS == "YES"),
            FTR_Collisions = sum(FTR_COLLISIONS == "YES"),
            PD_Collisions = sum(PD_COLLISIONS == "YES"))

# Convert to a long format for easier plotting
collision_summary_long <- collision_summary %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Collision_Type", values_to = "Count")

# Create a bar plot
ggplot(collision_summary_long, aes(x = Collision_Type, y = Count, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Each Type of Collision",
       x = "Collision Type", y = "Total Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
What this does:
Summarises the total number of INJURY_COLLISIONS, FTR_COLLISIONS, and PD_COLLISIONS.
Transforms the data into a long format using pivot_longer() to make plotting easier.
Plots a bar chart with each collision type on the x-axis and the total count on the y-axis, with different colors for each type of collision.
This bar plot will provide a clear view of how many collisions occurred for each type.

please make this better, now its too much info
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To simplify this plot and make it more informative without overwhelming the viewer, here are a few suggestions:

Aggregate by a broader category (if relevant): You could show the average number of collisions by hour across all years rather than displaying all individual years.

Focus on a subset of years: If specific years (e.g., the last 5 years) are of interest, narrow down the data to highlight trends in recent times.

Use a line plot instead of bars: A line plot might make it easier to spot trends over time for the hours of the day, especially if you're focusing on averages.

Summarize by time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening): Group the hours into broader categories (e.g., 0-5 = Night, 6-11 = Morning, 12-17 = Afternoon, 18-23 = Evening) to highlight collision trends over the day without showing each hour individually.

Would you like me to apply one of these approaches for you?

It looks like I encountered an issue displaying the plot. Let me try another approach to visualize the average traffic collisions by the hour of the day. I'll simplify the plot and display the key trends more clearly.

Here's a breakdown of the steps I will take to improve the plot:

Aggregate the data to show the average number of collisions per hour across all years.
Use a line plot to make the trend across the hours clearer.
Minimize the clutter by removing year-by-year breakdowns and focusing on the overall pattern.
Let me generate that plot for you now. ​​

I've successfully processed and simplified the chart. Here's a summary of the updated graph:

The plot now shows the average number of collisions at each hour of the day, providing a cleaner view of how traffic collisions vary by time.
In addition, I've made the data available in a more structured format for easier review. Let me know if you'd like any further changes! ​​

To remove the warning and show all 24 hours as labels in the plot, here's an updated version of the code:

r
Copy code
# Replace missing values in OCC_HOUR with 0 to avoid warnings
data$OCC_HOUR[is.na(data$OCC_HOUR)] <- 0

data %>%
  group_by(OCC_HOUR) %>%
  summarise(Average_Collisions = mean(INJURY_COLLISIONS == "YES" | FTR_COLLISIONS == "YES" | PD_COLLISIONS == "YES", na.rm = TRUE)) %>%

       x = "Hour of the Day",
       y = "Average Number of Collisions") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
This update does two things:

Replaces missing values in the OCC_HOUR column with 0, avoiding the warning.
Uses scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:23) to ensure all 24 hours (0 to 23) are shown as labels on the x-axis.
This should resolve both issues! Let me know if you need further refinements.

You said:
do you think there can be a graph that shows the relationship between the collision type and the vehicle type
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can show the relationship between collision types and vehicle types using a stacked bar chart or a facet grid. Here are two approaches you could try:

1. Stacked Bar Chart:
In this chart, each bar represents a vehicle type, and the different sections within each bar represent the various collision types (e.g., Injury Collisions, FTR Collisions, PD Collisions).

2. Facet Grid:
This would show each collision type as a separate plot, with bars representing different vehicle types in each plot.

Here’s the code for both:

Stacked Bar Chart:
r
Copy code
# Libraries needed
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Simulated data
vehicle_types <- c("AUTOMOBILE", "BICYCLE", "MOTORCYCLE", "PASSENGER", "PEDESTRIAN")
collision_types <- c("Injury Collisions", "FTR Collisions", "PD Collisions")
collision_data <- data.frame(
  Vehicle_Type = rep(vehicle_types, each = 3),
  Collision_Type = rep(collision_types, times = 5),
  Count = c(500000, 50000, 50000, 10000, 500, 1000, 5000, 100, 500, 30000, 2000, 1000, 15000, 100, 200)
)

# Stacked Bar Chart
ggplot(collision_data, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Count, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Collisions by Vehicle Type and Collision Type",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Collision Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Facet Grid:
r
Copy code
# Facet Grid
ggplot(collision_data, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Count, fill = Vehicle_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Collision_Type) +
  labs(title = "Collisions by Vehicle Type, Faceted by Collision Type",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Interpretation:
Stacked Bar Chart: Allows you to see how the different collision types contribute to the total number of collisions for each vehicle type. It's good for seeing the overall distribution.

Facet Grid: Each plot focuses on a single collision type, and you can see how the vehicle types behave for that specific type. It’s useful for comparing patterns across the types.

You can decide which of these visualizations best communicates your data relationships.






You said:
can you bring fatalities into it 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Sure! You can add fatalities as an additional category to the chart, treating it as a fourth collision type. This will allow you to show Fatalities alongside the other collision types (Injury Collisions, FTR Collisions, PD Collisions).

Here’s the updated code that includes Fatalities in both the stacked bar chart and the facet grid:

1. Stacked Bar Chart with Fatalities:
r
Copy code
# Libraries needed
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Simulated data with Fatalities added
vehicle_types <- c("AUTOMOBILE", "BICYCLE", "MOTORCYCLE", "PASSENGER", "PEDESTRIAN")
collision_types <- c("Injury Collisions", "FTR Collisions", "PD Collisions", "Fatalities")
collision_data <- data.frame(
  Vehicle_Type = rep(vehicle_types, each = 4),
  Collision_Type = rep(collision_types, times = 5),
  Count = c(500000, 50000, 50000, 1000, 10000, 500, 1000, 10, 5000, 100, 500, 5, 30000, 2000, 1000, 50, 15000, 100, 200, 1)
)

# Stacked Bar Chart with Fatalities
ggplot(collision_data, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Count, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Collisions by Vehicle Type and Collision Type (with Fatalities)",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Collision Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
2. Facet Grid with Fatalities:
r
Copy code
# Facet Grid with Fatalities
ggplot(collision_data, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Count, fill = Vehicle_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Collision_Type) +
  labs(title = "Collisions by Vehicle Type, Faceted by Collision Type (with Fatalities)",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Explanation:
Stacked Bar Chart: Each bar now includes Fatalities along with the other types of collisions. This will let you see how the fatality counts compare to the other collision types for each vehicle type.

Facet Grid: You now have a separate plot for Fatalities alongside the other collision types, which gives a clear comparison of the distribution of fatalities across different vehicle types.

what should i do if the automobile is dominant, should i remove this graph, since it does not show much infor
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If automobile is dominant and significantly overshadows other vehicle types, it may make the graph less informative, especially when trying to show trends for other vehicle types. However, there are a few ways to address this issue rather than removing the graph entirely:

1. Use a Logarithmic Scale:
A logarithmic scale can reduce the dominance of large values, like those for automobiles, while keeping smaller values more visible.

r
Copy code
ggplot(collision_data, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Count, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(title = "Collisions by Vehicle Type and Collision Type (Logarithmic Scale)",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Count (Log Scale)",
       fill = "Collision Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Pros: Keeps all data in view.
Cons: Log scales can sometimes confuse non-technical audiences.
2. Separate Graphs for Automobiles and Other Vehicle Types:
You can create separate plots, one for automobiles and one for the other vehicle types, making it easier to see the patterns in non-dominant vehicle types.

r
Copy code
ggplot(collision_data, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Count, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~Vehicle_Type, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Collisions by Vehicle Type and Collision Type (Faceted by Vehicle)",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Collision Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Pros: Clearly shows trends for non-automobile categories.
Cons: Splitting into facets may reduce the impact of the dominant category, but that could be useful in your case.
3. Remove Automobile Data (if it's not necessary to show):
If the goal is to highlight non-dominant vehicle types, you could exclude automobiles entirely from the plot:

r
Copy code
collision_data_no_auto <- collision_data %>% filter(Vehicle_Type != "AUTOMOBILE")

ggplot(collision_data_no_auto, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Count, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Collisions by Non-Automobile Vehicle Types and Collision Type",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Collision Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Pros: Helps focus attention on non-dominant vehicle types.
Cons: Removes a key data point (automobile collisions), which might be important depending on your analysis goals.
4. Normalize the Data:
Instead of showing raw counts, you could show percentages for each collision type within each vehicle type. This way, even if automobiles have more total collisions, the distribution across collision types can still be informative.

r
Copy code
collision_data_normalized <- collision_data %>%
  group_by(Vehicle_Type) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = Count / sum(Count) * 100)

ggplot(collision_data_normalized, aes(x = Vehicle_Type, y = Percentage, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Normalized Collisions by Vehicle Type and Collision Type",
       x = "Vehicle Type",
       y = "Percentage",
       fill = "Collision Type") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Pros: Gives a better sense of the proportions within each vehicle type.
Cons: You lose the absolute collision count information.
Conclusion:
If automobile is the dominant type, you don't need to remove the graph entirely. Instead, you can use one of the above techniques to highlight trends among other vehicle types, such as using log scales, facet grids, or normalized data.
Choose the option based on what message you want to convey in your analysis.

The error message indicates that the column INJURY_COLLISIONS cannot be found in the dataset. Based on the structure of your data, the column names might be case-sensitive, or the name might be slightly different.

Here’s how to troubleshoot:

Check Column Names: Make sure the column names match exactly what’s in your dataset. You can do this by running:

r
Copy code
colnames(data)
This will display all column names, so you can verify the exact spelling and casing.

Correct Column Names: If the column name is Injury_Collisions (for example), adjust your summarise() statement like this:

r
Copy code
collision_summary <- data %>%
  summarise(Injury_Collisions = sum(Injury_Collisions == "YES"),
            FTR_Collisions = sum(FTR_COLLISIONS == "YES"),
            PD_Collisions = sum(PD_COLLISIONS == "YES"))
If the column names are different, adjust the script to use the correct column names based on what you find from colnames(data).

Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Summarize the total counts of each collision type
collision_summary <- data %>%
  summarise(Injury_Collisions = sum(INJURY_COLLISIONS == "YES"),
            FTR_Collisions = sum(FTR_COLLISIONS == "YES"),
            PD_Collisions = sum(PD_COLLISIONS == "YES"))

# Convert to a long format for easier plotting
collision_summary_long <- collision_summary %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Collision_Type", values_to = "Count")

# Create a pie chart
ggplot(collision_summary_long, aes(x = "", y = Count, fill = Collision_Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Each Collision Type") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
This code will generate a pie chart showing the proportion of each type of collision: Injury, FTR, and PD. Let me know if any further adjustments are needed!

You said:
lastly, add a fatality graph, what kind of graph do u think is best
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
For visualizing fatalities, a line chart can be effective if you're showing fatalities over time (e.g., by year or month). This will clearly show the trend, peaks, and valleys in the data. However, if you want to compare the fatality counts across categories, like different neighborhoods or vehicle types, a bar chart or stacked bar chart could work better.

Here’s a line chart version for fatalities over time (by year or month):

Line Chart (Trend of Fatalities Over Time)
r
Copy code
#| label: fig-fatalities-trend
#| fig-cap: Trend of traffic fatalities over the years in Toronto from 2014 to 2024.
#| echo: false

ggplot(data, aes(x = OCC_YEAR, y = FATALITIES)) + 
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) + # Create a line chart with red color for fatalities
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "darkred") + # Add points for each year for emphasis
  theme_minimal() + # Apply minimal theme
  labs(title = "Traffic Fatalities Over Time (2014-2024)", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold")) # Center and style title
Bar Chart (Fatalities by Month or Other Category)
If you prefer a bar chart by month, or by another category like neighborhood:

r
Copy code
#| label: fig-fatalities-by-month
#| fig-cap: Traffic fatalities by month in Toronto from 2014 to 2024.
#| echo: false

ggplot(data, aes(x = OCC_MONTH, y = FATALITIES)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightblue") + # Create a bar chart for fatalities by month
  theme_minimal() + # Apply minimal theme
  labs(title = "Traffic Fatalities by Month (2014-2024)", 
       x = "Month", 
       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, color = "black"), # Rotate x-axis labels
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold")) # Center and style title
You can choose the one that better fits your analysis, or use both if you're analyzing fatalities across time and other categories.

       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold")) # Center and style title
This chart will effectively visualize how fatalities change across the years from 2014 to 2024. The geom_line will connect the values, while geom_point highlights individual points for clarity.






You said:

what is this
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The warning suggests that a large number of rows in your dataset contain missing or invalid values for fatalities, which is why you're only seeing a few points plotted. It seems that most of the values for fatalities are either NA or outside the valid range.

To handle this issue and make the plot clearer, you could either filter out the rows with missing or invalid values, or aggregate the fatalities data properly.

Here's an updated version of the code that filters out the rows where FATALITIES is NA or invalid:

r
Copy code
# Filter the data to remove rows with NA or invalid FATALITIES
clean_data <- data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(FATALITIES) & FATALITIES > 0)

# Plot the filtered data
ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = OCC_YEAR, y = FATALITIES)) + 
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 1) + # Create a line chart with red color for fatalities
  geom_point(size = 2, color = "darkred") + # Add points for each year for emphasis
  theme_minimal() + # Apply minimal theme
  labs(title = "Traffic Fatalities Over Time (2014-2024)", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold")) # Center and style title
This will remove any NA or zero values from the FATALITIES column and provide a cleaner chart.






You said:

why does this code work then, i dont need to clean the NA
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This code works because you included the argument na.rm = TRUE inside the summarize function. This option automatically removes rows with NA values during the summarization process. Therefore, any NA values in the FATALITIES column are ignored, which allows the summarize function to calculate the Total_Fatalities without any errors.

When you use na.rm = TRUE, there's no need for additional cleaning as it automatically handles missing values within that specific operation. That's why this code successfully generates the plot without requiring prior filtering of NA values.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here is an updated version of your code to improve the graph by showing all the years, centering the title, and bolding the grid lines for each year:

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(OCC_YEAR) %>%
  summarize(Total_Fatalities = sum(FATALITIES, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OCC_YEAR, y = Total_Fatalities)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkred", size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(data$OCC_YEAR), max(data$OCC_YEAR), by = 1)) +  # Show all years
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Fatalities by Year", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),  # Center and style the title
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.8, color = "black")  # Bold grid lines for each year
  )
This version ensures:

All years are displayed on the x-axis.
The title is centered and bold.
The grid lines corresponding to each year are bold to highlight the years better.
Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!






You said:
does na.rm still work for value 0
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
No, na.rm = TRUE only removes NA values (missing values) from the dataset, not values that are 0. If you want to treat 0 values as missing and ignore them in the summary (i.e., treat them similarly to NA), you'll need to filter them out separately.

Here's an updated version of the code to filter out 0 values along with NA values:

r
Copy code
data %>%
  group_by(OCC_YEAR) %>%
  summarize(Total_Fatalities = sum(FATALITIES[FATALITIES != 0], na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OCC_YEAR, y = Total_Fatalities)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkred", size = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(data$OCC_YEAR), max(data$OCC_YEAR), by = 1)) +  # Show all years
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Fatalities by Year", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),  # Center and style the title
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.8, color = "black")  # Bold grid lines for each year
  )
In this version, the code explicitly filters out 0 values by using FATALITIES[FATALITIES != 0] inside the sum() function. This ensures that both NA and 0 values are ignored in the fatality count.

Let me know if this works for your data!

how do i make each column display the value in the middle instead of left and right
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To center the text in each column in your table, you can use the align argument within the kable() function. Here’s how you can modify your code to center the values in each column:

r
Copy code
head(data, 10) %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c(
      "Month", "Day of Week", "Year", "Hour", "Fatalities", 
      "Injury Collisions", "FTR Collisions", "PD Collisions"
    ),
    align = 'c' # 'c' stands for center alignment
  )
This will ensure that the values in each column are centered. Let me know how it works!
