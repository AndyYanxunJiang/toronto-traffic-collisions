The error you're encountering is due to Git not knowing how to handle the differences between your local branch and the remote branch, which is referred to as "divergent branches." This happens when the local and remote branches have changes that aren't shared between them.

To resolve this, you need to specify how Git should handle the pull. You can choose between a few options depending on what you want to do:

Merge (default behavior): If you want Git to merge the changes, run:

arduino
Copy code
git config pull.rebase false
This will perform a normal merge of the local and remote branches when you pull.

Rebase: If you'd prefer Git to rebase your local commits on top of the remote changes (which can create a cleaner history), run:

arduino
Copy code
git config pull.rebase true
Fast-Forward Only: If you want Git to only pull if the local branch can be fast-forwarded (i.e., if no changes have been made locally), use:

arduino
Copy code
git config pull.ff only
You can also apply this configuration globally by adding the --global flag if you'd like it to be the default for all repositories:

csharp
Copy code
git config --global pull.rebase false  # For merge
git config --global pull.rebase true   # For rebase
git config --global pull.ff only       # For fast-forward only
If you only want to resolve this for the current pull, you can run one of these commands directly with the git pull command:

css
Copy code
git pull --rebase
git pull --no-rebase
git pull --ff-only
Choose the method that best fits your workflow.

Contains the sketches of potential analysis dataset and graph.

is the grammar correct

The grammar is slightly off. Here's a more polished version:

"Contains sketches of potential analyses, datasets, and graphs."

This phrasing is smoother and more grammatically correct. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!






You said:
the dataset and graph are for analysis purpose
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In that case, you could rephrase it as:

"Contains sketches of the dataset and graph for analysis purposes."

This clearly indicates that both the dataset and graph are intended for analysis.






You said:
those are potential analysis graphs and dataset
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You can phrase it as:

"Contains sketches of potential analysis graphs and datasets."

This version clearly conveys that both the graphs and datasets are for potential analysis.






You said:
do i still need the 's' if i have sketches already
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you would still need the plural form for "graphs" and "datasets" because "sketches" refers to multiple items, and you're describing multiple potential graphs and datasets. Here's the full sentence:

"Contains sketches of potential analysis graphs and datasets."

If you're referring to just one graph and one dataset, you could say:

"Contains a sketch of a potential analysis graph and dataset."

Otherwise, the plural form remains correct when you're talking about more than one.
